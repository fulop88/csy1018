        <h4>Software Engineering</h4>
        <h4>software engineering is fairly new and aspiring job. Software engineer is someone who would build/engineer a software such as desktop programs or mobile and web applications.
            Compared to a web developer, Software engineers cover large range of skill sets/possible roles. The term "engineer" implies a deeper knowledge of Computer Science
            topic such as data structures and algorithms.
        </h4>

        <h4>Web dveloper</h4>
        <h4>General and primary rule for web development is working with websites. 
            Coding and programming that will enable the website functionally for the owners requirements.

        </h4>

        <h4>Comparison</h4>
        <h4>Comparing two of the chosen jobs, I compared different factors like salary, work ethics, portable skills and etc. 
            This will help seeing the raw analysis of comparing both jobs.
        </h4>

        <div class="row">
                <div class="column"><h4>Salary</h4>
                    <h4>Software engineer, in UK avarage salary ranges from <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary">£24,139"- £53,709</a> but for a web developer avarge salary per year of <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Web_Developer/Salary">£16,750 - £37,187</a>
            This range between jobs is because software engineers are more valued within the market at the moment. When learning how to be a web developer, you could even do it yourself from home, gathering data and practicing by yourself. But being a software engineer, you have to work
        as a team. Software engineers range more skills and can apply them to more jobs compared to web developer. There are different aspects to being a web developer, but there is not such of range for the job on the market.</a>  	
        </h4></div>
                <div class="column"> <h4>Portable skills</h4>
            <h4>With software engineering, you learn a lot of different things in programming languages, software tools and etc. Applying different skillsets from one company to another, giving you a salary hike when switiching between companies.
            Web development, you don't as often work with a team. You may not find as many skills and experiences because working alone. It does help you applying those skills to different websites or areas but if you would work with a team for the first time you might find it hard or uncomfortable.
            Where software engineering is all about working with the team. The skills you get when working with new and different people can always help you in work or navigating yourself to do the right things. It is also better for fixing problems or debugging something as you might find different approaches to solutions.
