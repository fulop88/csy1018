        <h4>WHAT DOES A SOFTWARE ENGINEER DO?</h4>

                <h4>While the terms “software engineer” and “developer,” are often used interchangeably, there is one important distinction that separates the two roles. If a software developer is anyone who knows how to apply a programming language to develop and maintain a functioning application, a software engineer is simply a developer who does so using systematic engineering principles or methods. While there are many software development methodologies (i.e. Agile, XP, RAD, DSDM, etc.), they all involve different approaches to handling the systems development lifecycle (SDLC):
                
                    Planning and Requirement Analysis. This step involves taking feedback from customer, market research, and senior members of the team and distilling them into software requirements. Requirements are often formally defined in a software requirement specification (SRS). Feasibility studies and risk calculations are also performed in this stage.
                    Design. Here “design” refers to software engineering principles of architectural design, logical design, and physical design. In laymen’s terms, the requirements gathered in the previous step inform decisions on how to design the user interface, database management structure, and features of the eventual software product. The design approach is usually documented in a design document specification (DDS) and also covers how the software will be developed.
