<h1>First term web development.</h1>
<h4>First term of web development was really fun and positive for me. Doing this webstie I realise how much more I need to learn, and that coding, programming is something I really enjoy doing.
    I usually learn from trial and error, and this whole website was trial and errors all the time for me. But I do enjoy it. I like a challenge and to challange myself learning new things and overcoming the obstacles.
I am sure, that creating next website, or editing the code I would do much better next time. Now, I am much more comfortable and conscious of what is going on in the code, even though I still have a lot to learn about it.
But I do really enjoy how there are limitless posibilities to what you can and can't do. This type of "freedom" within the code is something I really like, in a way that the more web development skills you have, the more freedom you create for yourself.
This first term was a foundation cement for my future knowledge. I am looking forward to learn new things across the whole course of web development, software engineering and more.

<h4>Unfortunately I do not have drawn sketches we did within the team, but this is something that I started with. This was the initial idea after looking at different websties.
    I created this image in my head and then drew it out using paint. There I've set some bulletpoints which I continued to follow throughout the website development. They kept my website structure same, and overall helped me stay with the same idea of the website.

<h4>This is the evidence of my validation. When I ran my website using <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/">w3 validator</a> it found 8 errors. Those were missing tags and elements, mostly mistakes that new web developer like me would do.
    I tried to fix majority of them, first in order but later anything that I could understand and fix and it did not work for me. When trying to fix them, layout errors and more code errors appeard. Sadly I lack skills or understandment of those problems and what solutions to them are.
    When creating my next website I would try to avoid these problems and be much more accurate with my code. This is really important for any website as having mess like my webstie does creates for more and more problems. If I paid more attention to details I would be much better of when validating my website.
