<h1>First term web development.</h1>
<h4>First term of web development was really fun and positive for me. Doing this webstie I realise how much more I need to learn, and that coding, programming is something I really enjoy doing.
    I usually learn from trial and error, and this whole website was trial and errors all the time for me. But I do enjoy it. I like a challenge and to challange myself learning new things and overcoming the obstacles.
I am sure, that creating next website, or editing the code I would do much better next time. Now, I am much more comfortable and conscious of what is going on in the code, even though I still have a lot to learn about it.
But I do really enjoy how there are limitless posibilities to what you can and can't do. This type of "freedom" within the code is something I really like, in a way that the more web development skills you have, the more freedom you create for yourself.
This first term was a foundation cement for my future knowledge. I am looking forward to learn new things across the whole course of web development, software engineering and more.
