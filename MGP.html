        <h4>I have used <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/true-digital">this</a> page for my design inspiration, finding different colour styles and pallets for the werbsite
            The current color scheme is similar but used in a different way. With my main colour being white, I added those bring/smooth colours to the footer and navigation to the page, making it look more exciting.
            I think the colours compliment my background image, as the colors are similar but different opacity. Designing from mobile to desktop, me and a group of people talked about the current design. The current color scheme is similar but used in a different way. The expectations people have when wisiting a website, and how to improve those expectation when wising a new website.
        Unfortunately, because I don't have all the skills needed to create such a webstie, I tried to implement as much as I could to my website.

    <h4>One of my biggest influencials for the website was a YaHoo page.

    <h2>This kind of page structure is what I was inspired from when creating my web page. This was the ground of how my placement of the content would appear for the user and I can explain why.
        This might look like an older page, as currently you would commonly see a large where you scroll down until the content ends, but I didn't exactly like that for my idea.
    I like when all the content is carefully and neatly spreaded around a single page of standart format. When talking to my team, we discussed different variations and decided to try different styles on sketches. 
    Unfortunately I do not have pictures of the sketches but I did learn a lot from them. I was interested in how the user approaches the website, what he sees first and what his attention is attracted to at all times.
    This helped me create my own website in a way that I follow the attention of the user making sense with my content. You will see things where you expect them to see, allowing for easier use of the website.
    I remember how frustrating it can be when a website has confusing UI, where you don't find things where you would expect them to be, or can't reach a simple thing fast, making for a terrible experience.
    I also realised how important that is for UI and MGP to be easy and fast for the user. It's something that you have to be clever, creative and fully thought out. Small details can really change the overall experience for the website
    in a good or bad way, depending how you use them.
